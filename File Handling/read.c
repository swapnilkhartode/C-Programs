// Read a File
#include<stdio.h>

int main()
{
    FILE *fptr;

    // Open file in read mode
    fptr= fopen("ABC.txt","r");
    
}

/*
To read from a file , you can use the r mode.

This will make the filename.txt opened for reading.
Next,we need to create a string that should be big enough to store the content of the file.
lets create string str[100];
